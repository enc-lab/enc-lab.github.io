## Welcome!

Welcome to the Energy and Clouds modeling Lab website, at the [DIMEC](http://www.dimec.cl) - [FCFM](https://ingenieria.uchile.cl/) - [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl). Our work combines the fields of renewable energy and cloud physics, and is motivated by the current need for decarbonization in the context of climate and biodiversity crisis. Renewable energy is inherently variable, and for solar energy the short term variability comes primarily from passing clouds, thus the need to better understand their dynamics using atmospheric CFD and other techniques. We also work quantifying the effects of resource variability on conversion devices, characterizing and improving solar devices, analyzing energy efficiency measures on patrimonial buildings, and we are interested in other energy-water-food related problems, specially from a human scale development perspective.
