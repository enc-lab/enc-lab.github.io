## Welcome!

Welcome to the Energy and Clouds modeling Lab website, at the [DIMEC](http://www.dimec.cl) - [FCFM](https://ingenieria.uchile.cl/) - [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl). Our work is diverse, centered around the space between renewable energy and cloud physics. We are motivated by the current need for decarbonization, as well as our own curiosity on understanding nature and society. Renewable energy is inherently variable, and for solar energy the short term variability comes primarily from passing clouds, thus the need to better understand their dynamics. We also work on quantifying the effects of renewable resource variability on conversion devices, characterizing and improving solar devices, analyzing energy consumption on patrimonial and residential buildings, as well as assessing the future needs of heating and cooling.
