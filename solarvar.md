# Solar variability and forecasting, the role of clouds, and its effects on solar plants


## How does solar variability depend on time resolution and cloud type?

Solar variability corresponds to strong variations of the solar irradiance, caused mainly by the presence of clouds.
Practical uses of solar resource data, such as the design of photovoltaic solar plants, usually employs several years
of hourly data, neglecting subhourly features. The effect of clouds on short-time variability can differ by cloud type,
suggesting that some cloud effects could be more invisible than others when working with hourly data. In this work,
we study the effects of data time resolution on solar variability, and separate the analysis by cloud categories. We use
1 minute solar data and cloud radar products from the ARM CACTI campaign in Córdoba, Argentina, where a wide
variety of clouds exist. We classify the clouds based on their vertical position and observe solar variability using the
mean and standard deviation of the clear sky index for varying time resolutions of 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Time
resolution affects the mean and standard deviation of the clear sky index differently for each cloud type: coarser time
resolutions can not capture small variability and overestimate the mean clear sky index of low and mid clouds, while
high clouds do not change as much. The effect is also palpable when measuring ramps: the percentile 95 of the ramps
obtained with 1 minute data is 19 times greater compared to hourly data. This ratio varies per cloud type, with the
strongest differences occurring for mid clouds, having ramps that are 73 times stronger.
